I am an Associate Professor at York University. My research interests are primarily in Labour Economics. In particular, my research interests include the determinants of wage and employment, inequality, and occupation structure. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of British Columbia. I joined York University in 2011 and previously held an Assistant Professor position at Copenhagen Business school.
